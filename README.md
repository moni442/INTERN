# inventory-management-system
In this product we design an inventory management system.Here, by using the id we perform some functions like purchasing a product from the inventory , adding products into the inventory and also keep the records of the sales that happened.
# purchasing the products
We can purchase the products from the inventory by getting id from the user.First the user wants to give the id of the products which he wants to buy.
Then he wants to enter how much quantity he/she needs .
If such quantity of products is available in the inventory he will receive the bill,else he will receive the message stating "out of stock " .
If the id given by the user is not in the inventory then he will receive a messsage stating "invalid id".
# adding products 
We can add products into the inventory by giving the product new id,name,quantity and price.
We can either update the existing product or add a new product to the existing id.
We can update the existing product either by updating the quantity or price per unit or both.
We can add a new product to the existing id either by updating the quantity or name or price per unit or all of them.
# sales 
We can maintain the record of the products purchased by their id,quantity and bill amount 1.
